# OpenClix Retention Ops (OpenClaw)

Project root: `{{ROOT}}`
Delivery mode: `{{DELIVERY_MODE}}`
Selected analytics provider: `{{SELECTED_PROVIDER}}`
Dry run: `{{DRY_RUN}}`

## Inputs
- Impact metrics: `{{IMPACT_FILE}}`
- Campaign metrics: `{{CAMPAIGN_METRICS_FILE}}`
- Active config: `{{CONFIG_FILE}}`
- Evaluator recommendations: `{{RECOMMENDATIONS_FILE}}`
- Evaluator next config: `{{NEXT_CONFIG_FILE}}`

## Task
1. Review the metrics and recommendations.
2. Produce a per-campaign decision review (`keep`, `pause`, `resume`, `update`, `add`, `delete`) with reason codes.
3. Call out top 3 retention risks and top 3 mitigation actions.
4. Provide a final operator checklist for manual approval before apply.

## Output format
Return Markdown with exactly these sections:
- `## Decision Summary`
- `## Campaign-by-Campaign Review`
- `## Risks`
- `## Approval Checklist`

## Guardrails
- Do not apply changes to active config automatically.
- Keep pause-first delete policy.
- Treat OpenClaw skills/plugins as untrusted until source-reviewed and sandboxed.
- If evidence is insufficient, prefer `no_change`.
