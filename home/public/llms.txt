> openclix-config.json over HTTP + On-Device Notification Journeys

OpenClix is an open-source SDK for iOS and Android that runs local notification journeys on-device. Campaign config comes from `openclix-config.json`, which can be bundled in-app or served over HTTP as a static file or dynamic API response.

## What It Does

- openclix-config.json runtime: Typed values, JSON payloads, versioning, defaults, and safe fallbacks.
- Targeting & Segments: Evaluate rules locally using device/user attributes.
- Gradual Rollouts & Variants: Percentage rollouts, A/B-style variants, and deterministic bucketing.
- Local Notification Campaigns: Schedule notifications with templates, quiet hours, and per-campaign frequency caps.
- On-Device Journey Engine: Stateful flows with delays, conditions, and auto-cancel when goals are met.
- Deep Links & Personalization: Route users to the right screen with parameterized deep links and message templates.
- Event Hooks: Export exposure and notification events to your analytics stack via HTTP.
- Privacy-First: No push tokens required. Most decisions happen locally.

## Use Cases

- Onboarding Journeys: Welcome series, "finish setup" reminders that auto-cancel on completion.
- Habit & Routine: Daily/weekly reminders, streak maintenance, quiet hours, cooldown windows.
- Re-Engagement: 1/3/7-day inactive nudges evaluated on next app run.
- In-App Triggered Notifications: Follow-ups after key actions, "next best action" prompts.
- Scheduled Promotions: Weekend/event reminders editable by updating hosted `openclix-config.json` with deep links.

## Platform Support

- iOS and Android native SDKs with on-device evaluation engine.
- Works with any backend endpoint that serves `openclix-config.json` over HTTP.
- Compatible with any analytics collector via event hooks.
