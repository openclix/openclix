# OpenClix

> Open-source, local-first mobile app retention and engagement automation.

OpenClix is a source-first reference project for iOS and Android teams that want agent-based mobile app retention automation without starting from hosted push infrastructure.

## Capabilities by skill/script

- `openclix-init`: Automates OpenClix integration wiring (startup, event, lifecycle touchpoints).
- `openclix-design-campaigns`: Automates schema-valid campaign config generation.
- `openclix-analytics`: Automates provider detection and retention-impact reporting.
- `openclix-update-campaigns`: Automates conservative campaign action proposals.
- `retention_ops_automation.sh`: Automates OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Codex review prompt generation.
- `detect_pa.sh`: Detects installed analytics provider and OpenClix evidence.
- `detect_delivery_mode.sh`: Detects bundle/hosted/dual config delivery mode.
- `evaluate_campaigns.sh`: Evaluates pause/resume/update/add/delete suggestions from metrics.
- `verify_templates.sh`: Verifies multi-platform template contract integrity.

## Directional boundaries

- Local-first: engagement logic runs on-device.
- Source-first: runtime code is vendored in-repo.
- Not a hosted full platform: server-triggered real-time push remains out of scope.
