> Remote Config + On-Device Notification Journeys

OpenClix is an open-source SDK for iOS and Android that enables remote config, feature flags, on-device notification journeys, and local notification campaigns—without requiring push tokens or FCM.

## What It Does

- Remote Config: Typed values, JSON payloads, versioning, defaults, and safe fallbacks.
- Targeting & Segments: Evaluate rules locally using device/user attributes.
- Gradual Rollouts & Variants: Percentage rollouts, A/B-style variants, and deterministic bucketing.
- Local Notification Campaigns: Schedule notifications with templates, quiet hours, and per-campaign frequency caps.
- On-Device Journey Engine: Stateful flows with delays, conditions, and auto-cancel when goals are met.
- Deep Links & Personalization: Route users to the right screen with parameterized deep links and message templates.
- Event Hooks: Export exposure and notification events to your analytics stack via HTTP.
- Privacy-First: No push tokens required. Most decisions happen locally.

## Use Cases

- Onboarding Journeys: Welcome series, "finish setup" reminders that auto-cancel on completion.
- Habit & Routine: Daily/weekly reminders, streak maintenance, quiet hours, cooldown windows.
- Re-Engagement: 1/3/7-day inactive nudges evaluated on next app run.
- In-App Triggered Notifications: Follow-ups after key actions, "next best action" prompts.
- Scheduled Promotions: Weekend/event reminders editable via Remote Config with deep links.

## Platform Support

- iOS and Android native SDKs with on-device evaluation engine.
- Works with any backend (OpenClix Cloud or your own endpoint).
- Compatible with any analytics (PostHog, Segment, Amplitude, Mixpanel, or custom collector via event hooks).
