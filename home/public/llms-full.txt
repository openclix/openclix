# OpenClix — Full Documentation for LLMs

> Agent-based mobile app retention and engagement automation (local-first, source-first).

## Product summary

OpenClix is an open-source reference project for iOS and Android engagement logic. It helps teams automate retention and engagement operations through explicit skills and scripts while keeping runtime decisions on-device.

## What OpenClix automates today

### Skill layer

1. `openclix-init`
- Integrates OpenClix source templates into mobile apps.
- Wires initialization, event tracking, and lifecycle triggers.

2. `openclix-design-campaigns`
- Converts product goals and event taxonomy into schema-valid campaign config.
- Supports event/scheduled/recurring triggers with suppression controls.

3. `openclix-analytics`
- Detects supported analytics providers (Firebase, PostHog, Mixpanel, Amplitude).
- Wires OpenClix event forwarding and generates retention-impact artifacts.

4. `openclix-update-campaigns`
- Evaluates campaign performance and proposes pause/resume/update/add/delete actions.
- Produces draft next config with explicit confirmation gate.

### Script layer

1. `scripts/retention_ops_automation.sh`
- Orchestrates provider detection, delivery-mode detection, campaign evaluation, and agent prompt generation.
- Generates prompts for OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Codex.

2. `skills/openclix-analytics/scripts/detect_pa.sh`
- Detects installed analytics provider and OpenClix integration evidence.

3. `skills/openclix-update-campaigns/scripts/detect_delivery_mode.sh`
- Detects `bundle`, `hosted_http`, or `dual` config delivery mode.

4. `skills/openclix-update-campaigns/scripts/evaluate_campaigns.sh`
- Evaluates recommendations with conservative sampling guardrails.

5. `scripts/verify_templates.sh`
- Verifies cross-platform template contracts for React Native, Android, iOS, and Flutter.

## Core workflow

```text
openclix-init
  -> openclix-design-campaigns
  -> openclix-analytics
  -> openclix-update-campaigns
  -> retention_ops_automation.sh (OpenClaw/Claude Code/Codex prompt loop)
```

## Search-intent aliases

- agent-based mobile app retention automation
- mobile engagement automation
- agent-driven retention ops
- OpenClaw Claude Code Codex retention workflow
- on-device campaign operations

## Directional boundaries

- Local-first: campaign rule evaluation and suppression happen on-device.
- Source-first: OpenClix runtime code is copied into your repository.
- Not hosted full platform: OpenClix does not claim server-triggered real-time push orchestration.
