# OpenClix — Full Documentation for LLMs

> Remote Config + On-Device Notification Journeys

## Overview

OpenClix is an open-source SDK for iOS and Android that ships onboarding, habit, and re-engagement campaigns that run entirely on the device—without FCM. No push tokens. No deliverability promises. Just deterministic, on-device control.

## Core Features

### Remote Config, Not Just Flags
Typed values, JSON payloads, versioning, defaults, and safe fallbacks. Changes apply after the next config refresh (app start, foreground, and best-effort background refresh).

### Targeting & Segments (On-Device)
Evaluate rules locally using device/user attributes you choose to provide. No server roundtrip needed for targeting decisions.

### Gradual Rollouts & Variants
Percentage rollouts, A/B-style variants, and deterministic bucketing. Supports on-device variants and can emit exposure events to your analytics.

### Local Notification Campaigns
Schedule notifications with templates, quiet hours, and per-campaign frequency caps. Notifications are scheduled on the device and do not require push infrastructure.

### On-Device Journey Engine
Stateful flows with delays, conditions, and auto-cancel when goals are met. Journey state is managed locally on the device.

### Deep Links & Personalization
Route users to the right screen with parameterized deep links and message templates.

### Event Hooks (Bring Your Own Analytics)
Export exposure + notification events to your analytics stack via HTTP. Compatible with PostHog, Segment, Amplitude, Mixpanel, or your own collector.

### Privacy-First by Design
No push tokens required. Most decisions happen locally on the device.

## Use Cases

### Onboarding Journeys
- Welcome series with step-by-step nudges
- "Finish setup" reminders that auto-cancel when completed

### Habit & Routine
- Daily/weekly reminders at user-chosen times
- Streak maintenance, quiet hours, cooldown windows

### Re-Engagement (Last-Seen Based)
- 1/3/7-day inactive nudges
- "You haven't tried X yet" prompts (evaluated on next app run)

### In-App Triggered Notifications
- Immediate follow-ups after key actions
- "Next best action" prompts after screen visits or events

### Scheduled Promotions
- Weekend/event reminders you can edit anytime via Remote Config
- Deep links to offers, content, or paywalls

## Quick Start

1. Add the SDK: Install the OpenClix SDK for iOS or Android and initialize it in your app.
2. Define flags + config: JSON values, variants, rollout rules — all managed remotely.
3. Publish journeys: Local notification schedules + on-device rules. Updates propagate when the app fetches config.

## Platform Compatibility

- iOS + Android: Native SDKs with an on-device evaluation engine.
- Any Backend: Fetch Remote Config from OpenClix Cloud or your own endpoint.
- Any Analytics: PostHog, Segment, Amplitude, Mixpanel — or your own collector (via event hooks).

## FAQ

### Can OpenClix replace Braze or OneSignal?
For scheduled/on-device journeys (onboarding, habits, last-seen re-engagement, in-app triggers): yes, partially. For server-triggered real-time push (payments, chat, security alerts, time-sensitive ops): no — use APNs/FCM push for that.

### Will notifications work if the app hasn't been opened in a long time?
Only if they were scheduled ahead of time on the device. OpenClix does not "wake" devices like push.

### Can I change copy, links, targeting, and timing without shipping an app update?
Yes — via Remote Config. Changes apply after the next config refresh.

### Do you support A/B tests?
OpenClix supports on-device variants and bucketing and can emit exposure events to your analytics.
