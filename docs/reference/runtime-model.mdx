OpenClix executes engagement logic on-device.

## Execution flow

```text
config source (in-app JSON or HTTPS JSON)
  -> app event
  -> rule evaluation
  -> schedule/show message
  -> debug reason
```

## Observability goals

- What event happened
- What rule matched
- Why a message fired or was suppressed

## Why this model

This path removes early dependency on push-delivery infrastructure so teams can test retention hypotheses faster.
