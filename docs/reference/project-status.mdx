description: "Current project status and implementation focus."
---

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core project spec / direction | Defined | Scope, use cases, and architecture direction are documented. |
| Reference SDK / engine implementation | In progress | Main OSS implementation is the current focus. |
| Config JSON runtime model | Planned (Phase 1) | Start with app resource or HTTPS JSON input. |
| `openclix-config.json` HTTP delivery | Optional next phase | Static-file hosting and dynamic API delivery come after core local-first path. |
| Hosted control plane | Not required | Local-first path does not require Clix-hosted services. |

## Near-term focus

- Config JSON-driven rule model and scheduling runtime
- On-device eligibility/suppression evaluation
- Debuggable execution traces and reason outputs
- Stable interfaces for hosted `openclix-config.json` delivery
