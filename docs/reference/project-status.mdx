---

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core project spec / direction | Defined | Scope, use cases, and architecture direction are documented. |
| Source-distributed reference runtime | Available (template-based) | `openclix-init` provides React Native / Flutter / iOS / Android source templates with verification scripts. |
| Config JSON runtime model | Implemented in current templates | `openclix/config/v1` schema and runtime touchpoints for bundled or HTTPS config are available in the workflow. |
| Agent retention operations workflow | Implemented (review-loop automation) | `openclix-analytics` + `openclix-update-campaigns` + `retention_ops_automation.sh` generate review artifacts with explicit human approval gates. |
| `openclix-config.json` HTTP delivery | Supported (app-owned endpoint) | Hosted JSON delivery is supported without requiring OpenClix-hosted services. |
| Hosted control plane | Not required | Local-first path does not require Clix-hosted services. |

## Near-term focus

- Expand reproducible operator evidence and KPI case studies.
- Harden campaign evaluator heuristics and delivery-mode apply runbooks.
- Keep cross-platform template parity and verification coverage.
- Continue stabilizing interfaces for bundled and hosted `openclix-config.json` delivery.
