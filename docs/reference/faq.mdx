## Is this a notification library or a full platform?

OpenClix is an open-source reference codebase for on-device engagement logic, not a hosted full engagement platform.

## Do I install OpenClix as a package dependency?

No. OpenClix is source-distributed: client code is copied into your repository and checked in.

## Do I need a backend or push infrastructure?

Not for the local-first path. You can start without APNS/FCM send pipelines.

## Do I need Clix-hosted services or a control plane?

No. OpenClix is designed to run in your app with your own integrations.

## Can I use Firebase/PostHog/Supabase with this?

Yes. These are adapter-pattern directions, with local rule execution kept stable in-app.

## When is OpenClix enough vs a full engagement platform?

OpenClix is strong for local-first onboarding/habit/re-engagement/feature-discovery flows. If you need complex vendor tooling or server-triggered real-time push operations, pair it with a fuller engagement stack.
