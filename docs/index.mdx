OpenClix helps teams run onboarding, habit, re-engagement, and feature-discovery messaging with local-first execution and agent-based mobile app retention automation workflows.

The project is designed to be:

- Open source and auditable
- Source-first (vendored client code, not runtime SDK lock-in)
- Agent-friendly (explicit interfaces and clear edit points)
- Practical for fast retention experiments

## Start Here

- [Install and integrate OpenClix](/getting-started/installation)
- [Run the OpenClix workflow](/getting-started/workflow)
- [Verify your integration](/getting-started/verification)
- [Run the agent-based mobile app retention automation workflow](/guides/agent-retention-automation)

## Conceptual Flow

```text
config source (app resource JSON or HTTPS JSON)
  -> app event
  -> rule evaluation
  -> schedule/show message
  -> debug reason
```

## What OpenClix Is Not

OpenClix is not a hosted full engagement platform and does not require a Clix-hosted control plane for the local-first path.
