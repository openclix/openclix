OpenClix is currently delivered as agent skills plus reference templates.
This installation path is intended for agent-based mobile app retention and engagement automation.

## Option A: Agent-first (recommended)

Use this prompt in your coding agent:

```text
Install OpenClix skills from https://github.com/openclix/openclix and integrate OpenClix into this project.
Use openclix-init to detect platform, copy templates into the dedicated OpenClix namespace,
wire initialization/event/lifecycle touchpoints, and run build verification.
Then use openclix-design-campaigns to create .clix/campaigns/app-profile.json
and generate .clix/campaigns/openclix-config.json.
Then use openclix-analytics to detect installed Firebase/PostHog/Mixpanel/Amplitude,
forward OpenClix events with openclix tags, and produce a pre/post impact report
for D7 retention and engagement metrics.
Then use openclix-update-campaigns to draft campaign action recommendations.
Then run scripts/retention_ops_automation.sh with --agent all to generate
OpenClaw, Claude Code, and Codex review prompts before apply.
Do not add dependencies without approval.
```

## Option B: Manual skill install

1. Install skills:

```bash
npx skills add openclix/openclix
```

2. Run `openclix-init` in your app project.
3. Run `openclix-design-campaigns` to generate campaign config.
4. Run `openclix-analytics` to wire event forwarding and produce impact outputs.
5. Run `openclix-update-campaigns` to draft campaign operation changes.
6. Run `scripts/retention_ops_automation.sh` to generate OpenClaw/Claude Code/Codex review prompts.

## Option C: Claude Code plugin marketplace

Use Claude Code marketplace registration when you want managed plugin updates:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add openclix/openclix
claude plugin marketplace update openclix
claude plugin install openclix@openclix
```

For local pre-release validation from a checkout:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/openclix
```

To pull marketplace/plugin updates later:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update openclix
claude plugin update openclix@openclix
```

Validate plugin manifests locally before publishing:

```bash
bash scripts/validate_claude_plugin.sh
```

Continue with the [agent-based mobile app retention automation workflow](/getting-started/workflow).
