description: "Recommended OpenClix workflow from integration to campaign design and impact analysis."
---

## 1. Integrate with `openclix-init`

`openclix-init`:

- Detects platform (Expo/RN/Flutter/iOS/Android)
- Copies local-source templates into your repo
- Wires minimal initialization/event/lifecycle touchpoints
- Reuses existing dependencies where possible
- Runs platform-appropriate build/analyze verification

## 2. Generate config with `openclix-campaign-design`

`openclix-campaign-design`:

- Creates a structured campaign planning profile
- Designs lifecycle campaigns (onboarding/habit/re-engagement/milestone/feature discovery)
- Produces schema-valid config (`openclix/config/v1`)

Expected output:

- `.clix-campaigns/app-profile.json`
- `.clix-campaigns/openclix-config.json`

## 3. Measure impact with `openclix-analytics`

`openclix-analytics`:

- Detects provider: Firebase > PostHog > Mixpanel > Amplitude
- Wires OpenClix event forwarding with `openclix_*` properties
- Produces pre/post impact artifacts for retention + engagement

Expected output:

- `.clix-analytics/impact-metrics.json`
- `.clix-analytics/impact-report.md`
