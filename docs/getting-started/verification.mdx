## Build and runtime checks

- Run your platform build/analyze commands successfully.
- Confirm OpenClix touchpoints are wired in app initialization/event/lifecycle paths.
- Confirm local notification / in-app hook paths execute in test scenarios.

## Artifact checks

- `.clix-campaigns/openclix-config.json` exists and is schema-valid.
- `.clix-analytics/impact-metrics.json` exists.
- `.clix-analytics/impact-report.md` exists.

## Behavior checks

- At least one representative campaign path can fire under expected conditions.
- Suppression and quiet-hour logic behave as configured.
- Debug reasons are available for fired and suppressed outcomes.
