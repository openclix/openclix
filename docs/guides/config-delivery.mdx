OpenClix supports two delivery paths for config JSON.

## App resource JSON

Use bundled config in the app package when you want:

- Maximum determinism
- No network dependency at evaluation time
- Release-based config updates

## HTTPS JSON

Use remote JSON when you want:

- Faster iteration without app release for each rules change
- Central config management
- Dynamic or static serving options

Both patterns are valid:

- Static asset JSON (CDN/object storage)
- Dynamically generated JSON (API/server response)

## Recommendation

Start with app resource JSON, then move to HTTPS JSON when iteration speed requirements increase.
