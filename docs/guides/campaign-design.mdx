title: "Campaign Design"
description: "Design lifecycle campaigns and generate schema-valid OpenClix config."
---

Use `openclix-campaign-design` to convert product goals + event taxonomy into executable config.

## Typical campaign families

- Onboarding nudges
- Re-engagement reminders
- Streak maintenance
- Milestone messages
- Feature discovery prompts

## Guardrails to apply

- Use trigger and suppression logic that is deterministic and auditable.
- Model `do_not_disturb` and `frequency_cap` explicitly.
- Keep copy concise and action-oriented.
- Validate config before shipping (see [Verification](/getting-started/verification)).

## Output artifacts

- `.clix-campaigns/app-profile.json`
- `.clix-campaigns/openclix-config.json`
