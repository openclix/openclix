description: "Deliver openclix-config.json over HTTP while keeping local rule execution stable."

Delivery patterns are optional and come after the local-first base is working.

## Recommended directions

- **Static HTTP JSON**: Host `openclix-config.json` on CDN/object storage/static web hosting.
- **Dynamic JSON API**: Return schema-compatible `openclix-config.json` payloads from your backend.
- **No app redeploy updates**: Change hosted JSON content to adjust copy, timing, and suppression rules without shipping a new build.
- **Schema check before publish**: Run the validation flow in [Verification](/getting-started/verification).

## Principle

Treat config delivery as a replaceable transport layer, not as a core rule-engine dependency.
