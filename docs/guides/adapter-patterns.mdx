title: "Adapter Patterns"
description: "Integrate OpenClix with external systems while keeping local rule execution stable."

Adapter patterns are optional and come after the local-first base is working.

## Planned directions

- **Firebase Remote Config**: Use as config input source while keeping evaluation and scheduling in-app.
- **PostHog**: Map flags/events into OpenClix hooks without coupling rule logic to provider APIs.
- **Supabase**: Use your own tables/endpoints as a config source while preserving local execution flow.

## Principle

Treat provider integrations as replaceable adapters, not as core rule-engine dependencies.
