# OpenClix Schemas

This directory stores repo-local schema artifacts (contract files), separate from Mintlify docs, so they are easy to discover for both humans and AI agents.

## Available Schemas

- `openclix-campaign-config.schema.json`: Base OpenClix campaign config schema (`openclix/campaign-config/v1`)

## Notes

- This is the base schema contract for the local-first campaign config.
- The current MVP runtime uses a restriction layer described in the MVP spec note (for example: local file source and local notification usage in runtime).
